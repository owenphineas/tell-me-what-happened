# tell-me-what-happened

## Project Proposal:

Our proposed application would allow you to enter a date and return things that happened on that date. It would search the Wikipedia and New York Times APIs, allowing you not only to see events that happened but also the news articles and first person accounts of those events. The New York Times was founded in 1851, so we will only be allowing the user to search dates after a certian point as there will be no search results for years earlier than that.
